# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template


## Approach
I approached this challenge by first analysing all requirements and breaking them down into logical, interconnected components. My priority order was based on establishing core functionality first, followed by error handling, user experience improvements, and finally visual enhancements.

I started with the data fetching and display functionality as it formed the foundation of the application. This involved creating a function in the script.js file to fetch data from the backend data file and display it.

Next I worked on implementing error handling for missing data. To do this I created an if statement, that checks if data has a null name or price value it skips that item.

I was not able to complete the task of sending data via the API, but I designed the form that would be used for the process.

Finally, I worked on improving the overall design and UX. I approached this by improving the design of the displayed data and adding a image banner.


## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
During this challenge, my most significant effort went into creating a user-friendly way to send data to the backend API, which took multiple attempts but could not get it successfully running.

While I attempted the optional objective, I had to make the practical decision to focus on the core requirements due to time constraints.

For the UI improvements, I kept it simple but effective, focusing on readability and intuitive interaction.


## Problems Faced
The main challenge I faced was working with the backend API for data submission. Initially, I struggled with getting the data format correct, which led to failed API calls. I overcame this by implementing data transformation functions and using console logging to debug the API responses. Another significant issue was handling missing data from the API responses, which would cause the frontend to crash when attempting to display certain fields. I resolved this by adding null checks and default values for missing data, ensuring a smoother user experience.



## Evaluation
Overall, I found this challenge to be a valuable learning experience, though I recognise there's room for improvement in my implementation. Due to my ongoing commitments with both employment and university work, I had to carefully manage my time, which impacted the depth I could achieve in some areas.

One particular area where I acknowledge my limitations is with Git - as I'm still learning version control, I know my repository management could have been more organised and my commit messages more descriptive.

If I were to attempt this challenge again with more time, I would focus on improving my Git workflow, implement more comprehensive testing, and potentially tackle the optional objective I had to set aside. I would also spend more time refining the user interface and adding additional error handling scenarios. 

This challenge has helped me identify areas where I need to further develop my skills, particularly in version control and time management while juggling multiple commitments."
